# [Project 2: Newsfeed Engagement Analysis in Tableau](https://github.com/Allan-Ofula/Newsfeed-Engagement-Analysis-in-Tableau-Project)
This project involved analyzing user engagement with the 365Data Science platform's Newsfeed feature using Tableau. The goal was to uncover actionable insights to improve user interaction and optimize the Newsfeedâ€™s performance over a five-month period (January 1, 2023 â€“ May 31, 2023).

- Analyzed User Interaction Patterns and visualized how users engage with different types of Newsfeed posts.
- Identified Popular posts and subtypes that received the most likes and comments.
- Measured the proportion of users engaging with the Newsfeed through likes, comments, or manual posts.
- Provided Recommendations based on data analysis, suggested strategies to enhance user engagement.

**Visualizations Created**
- Dual Axis Chart: Displayed the monthly count of posts alongside the average likes per post, highlighting content popularity and user engagement trends over time.
- Bar Charts:
-Total Number of Posts
-Total Likes Received
-Total Comments Received
- User Activity Bar Chart: Visualized the number of visitors, active users, and those engaging through likes, comments, or manual posts.

# [Project 3: Aviation Safety Risk Analysis](https://github.com/Allan-Ofula/Aviation-Safety-Risk-Analysis-Project-Phase1)
This project involved analyzing aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 using data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The goal was to identify the safest and lowest-risk aircraft for a company expanding into the aviation industry.

- Analyzed Accident Data: Focused on aircraft models with the highest and lowest accident rates over the years.
- Explored Risk Trends: Examined accident patterns over time and across different aircraft types.
- Created visualizations to display accident severity and risk distribution by different aircraft models and types.
- Provided Recommendations: Suggested strategic decisions for purchasing based on historical safety data.

**Visualizations Created**
- Accident Trends by Aircraft Model: Highlighted trends in accidents over time by aircraft model.
- Accidents Over Time: Showed the annual trend of aviation accidents.
- Risk Distribution by Aircraft Type: Displayed risk distribution across various aircraft types and accident severity.

# [Project 4: Retail Sales Data Analysis With Pandas](https://github.com/Allan-Ofula/retail_sales_data_analysis_with_pandas)
This project analyzed a retail sales dataset using Python and Pandas to uncover key business insights. The dataset includes 30,000 records covering store locations, product categories, sales revenue, discounts, and marketing spend. The goal was to optimize sales strategies, improve revenue, and understand sales trends.

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, duplicates, and standardized data types.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified sales trends, product performance, and marketing effectiveness.
- Revenue & Sales Trends: Computed total sales and revenue patterns over time.
- Best-Performing Products: Analyzed top-selling products based on total revenue and revenue per unit.
- Discount Impact: Assessed the profitability of high vs. low-discount sales.
- Holiday vs. Non-Holiday Sales: Compared revenue performance during holidays vs. regular days.
- Marketing Spend Effectiveness: Measured the correlation between marketing spend and sales revenue.
- Correlation Analysis: Explored relationships between revenue, discounts, and marketing spend using a heatmap.

**Tools Used**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

# [Project 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas](https://github.com/Allan-Ofula/EDA-with-Pandas--Cumulative-Lab)
This project involved performing a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Ames Housing dataset using Pandas. The goal was to uncover insights about house prices, key features, and correlations.

- Data Cleaning & Inspection: Loaded, explored, and ensured dataset integrity (1460 rows, 80 columns).
- Data Distribution Analysis: Examined SalePrice, TotRmsAbvGrd, and OverallCond, identifying trends and outliers.
- Subset Analysis: Compared house prices based on Overall Condition, revealing a strong relationship with price.
- Correlation Analysis:
   - GrLivArea (Above-ground living area) was most positively correlated with price.
   - Age (Years since construction at time of sale) was negatively correlated, showing that older homes tend to sell for less.
- Feature Engineering: Created a new feature (Age = YrSold - YearBuilt) and analyzed its impact on home prices.

This project demonstrates data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques to derive meaningful insights from real estate data.

# [Project 6: Superhero Eye Color Analysis](https://github.com/Allan-Ofula/Pandas-Data-Cleaning-Checkpoint)
This project explores the distribution of superhero eye colors, focusing on the "good" aligned characters. The analysis utilized Pandas for data processing and Matplotlib for visualizing the data.

- Data Cleaning & Filtering: Filtered out superheroes with neutral or villain alignments and handled missing values.
- Eye Color Analysis: Identified the top 5 most common eye colors among superheroes.
- Visualization: Created a bar chart to show the frequency of each eye color.
- Key Insights:
- Blue eyes were the most frequent.
- Brown and green eyes were also common, with rare colors like red and white appearing less often.
  
This project combines data analysis with a fun look at superhero demographics, offering insights into the visual patterns of iconic characters.
